### DPS Meter Compatability
I have patched the bug, however sometimes it will crash with DPS meter because the script for DPS Meter is not working, and Frydom needs to patch his script for compatability to rework. Thank you!

# Stein UI Styles Lite
Stein UI Styles Lite is a lightweight version of the original Stein UI Styles by Cullen. By request of PixelArtist, I have created a lightweight version with better sizes of the boxes, minimap toggle and other convenient resources that were not incuded in the base Stein UI Styles. Base code still goes out to him, but this is the upgraded version. This version of Stein UI Styles also works on every server, which means unlike the old one, you do not have to modify the script entirely when you change servers, it is already built-in.

## Install Stein-UI-Styles-Lite
You may download the latest version on the packages on the github or use the greasyfork page (which might not be the latest version) to instal it directly into your tampermonkey/other addons.

## Controls:
Press Y to toggle on/off minimap. Please note that this only works if you do not have a keybind set as "y" already.
