# Stein-UI-Styles-Lite
This is a modified version of Stein UI Styles by Cullenn. @PixelArtist has asked me to create a lightweight modification to the original Stein UI Styles. This will remove a bunch of unnecessary extra features as well as add modern server support.

Install this here:

Or go onto Tampermonkey/ any other browser code injectors and copy and paste what is in index.js

Thanks!
