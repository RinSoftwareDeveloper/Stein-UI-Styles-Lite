### Stein World Update Notice
Stein.World has a new patch that will make Stein UI Styles' Username Add-On fail to work, so on thursday, I will try my best to update Stein UI Styles Lite as quickly as I can. Thank you!

# Stein UI Styles Lite
Stein UI Styles Lite is a lightweight version of the original Stein UI Styles by Cullen. By request of PixelArtist, I have created a lightweight version with better sizes of the boxes, minimap toggle and other convenient resources that were not incuded in the base Stein UI Styles. Base code still goes out to him, but this is the upgraded version. This version of Stein UI Styles also works on every server, which means unlike the old one, you do not have to modify the script entirely when you change servers, it is already built-in.

## Install Stein-UI-Styles-Lite
You may download the latest version on the packages on the github or use the greasyfork page (which might not be the latest version) to instal it directly into your tampermonkey/other addons.

## Controls:
Press Y to toggle on/off minimap. Please note that this only works if you do not have a keybind set as "y" already.
